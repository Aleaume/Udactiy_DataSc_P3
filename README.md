# Udactiy_DataSc_P3
Udacity Data Science Project 3 - Recommendation Engines (IBM collaboration)

In the IBM Watson Studio, there is a large collaborative community ecosystem of articles, datasets, notebooks, and other A.I. and ML. assets. Users of the system interact with all of this. Within this scope, we created this recommendation system project to enhance the user experience and connect them with assets. This personalizes the experience for each user.
